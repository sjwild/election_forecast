This is the repo for a model I am building to try forecast the 2024 US prediential election. It is done purely for my own amusement. 

At the moment this is nothing more than a mostly-empty repo. As I work at building the model, it will gradually get some actual content. Until then, you are out of luck if you are looking for the model code. There is a short script to download some election results from the Harvard Dataverse. 

More to come.
